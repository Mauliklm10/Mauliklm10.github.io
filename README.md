The goal is to create a portfolio website where I can showcase my progress at NJIT throughout the years and use it as application material for jobs and internships. I wish to pursue a career in busines analytics and then move on to a data science position and pursue either a masters degree or an MBA. I will compile all necessary documents on this website for optimal utilization to hopefully attain a job at a company of my preference.

The audience is first and foremost you the professor along with my future employers with whom I wish to pursue paid internships with along with full time opportunities later on as well. There is no particular demographic I am concerned with such as race, age, sex, type of industry etc.

The pages of my website will include my resume, cover letter, key courses taken at NJIT, projects which I have completed and those that I am currently working on, extracurriculars I have done and my life in general as well.

I will have a contact form so employers can reach out to me from there for job positions or consultancy.

For easy navigation of the website implementation of buttons to help people go from one page to the other.

I want to be contacted by multiple recruiters from companies wanting to schedule interviews with their respective companies for internships and full-time opportunities.
